								<h3 class="editable">Why concentrates?</h3>
								<p class="editable">Concentrates are the most medicinal parts of the cannabis plant that have been separated from the plant by a process called extraction, and then further refined to produce a concentrated medicine. They have gained popularity recently, because of their effectiveness, versatility, and purity. Concentrates are used in edibles, topicals, and can be smoked. Some of the greatest examples of healing that we have seen have been from patients ingesting the oils in their raw forms. All of the extracted material is beneficial, and used as medicine. The extract, basically, consists of oils and plant waxes.&nbsp;</p>

								<h3 class="editable">Extraction processes</h3>
								<p class="editable">There are several ways to extract medicinal properties from cannabis. The most common are: Supercritical CO2, Ethanol, Hydrocarbons (Butane, Propane, Hexane) and physical removal (Hashish).<br />CO2 and Hashish require very little processing to get a safe, consumable final product. Ethanol, and Hydrocarbons, on the other hand have to have the solvents removed before the medicine is safe to consume.<br />&nbsp;</p>

								<h3 class="editable">Patients</h3>
								<p class="editable">Unfortunately, medical cannabis patients must have patience. Our current laws prevent us from providing any medicine. Once the dispensary program in Hawaii is allowed to supply our medicine to registered card holders, we will hopefully be in a position to provide high quality, safe medicinals. For now, we can provide information to help you in your search for how to make concentrates, ingesting methods, and common dosages. Any advice that we give is not meant to be medical advice, only guidance to most effectively administer medicine for your particular needs. Always check with your physician before self medicating.<br />Our Facebook page &nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/bigislandextracts/?fref=ts">https://www.facebook.com/bigislandextracts/?fref=ts</a>&nbsp;is the best resource for links to articles about cannabis, updates about the DOH application process, cutting edge news in the cannabis world, and access to other patient advocacy websites. Please come join the conversation.&nbsp;</p>

								<h3 class="editable">Why concentrates?</h3>
								<p class="editable">Concentrates are the most medicinal parts of the cannabis plant that have been separated from the plant by a process called extraction, and then further refined to produce a concentrated medicine. They have gained popularity recently, because of their effectiveness, versatility, and purity. Concentrates are used in edibles, topicals, and can be smoked. Some of the greatest examples of healing that we have seen have been from patients ingesting the oils in their raw forms. All of the extracted material is beneficial, and used as medicine. The extract, basically, consists of oils and plant waxes.&nbsp;</p>

								<h3 class="editable">Extraction processes</h3>
								<p class="editable">There are several ways to extract medicinal properties from cannabis. The most common are: Supercritical CO2, Ethanol, Hydrocarbons (Butane, Propane, Hexane) and physical removal (Hashish).<br />CO2 and Hashish require very little processing to get a safe, consumable final product. Ethanol, and Hydrocarbons, on the other hand have to have the solvents removed before the medicine is safe to consume.<br />&nbsp;</p>
